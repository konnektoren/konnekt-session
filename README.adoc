= Konnekt Session

Konnekt Session is a library for managing multiplayer game sessions. It provides a lobby for players to join, where admins can select activities for the lobby, and players can participate in these activities. Admins can start and stop activities, and the results of the activities are displayed to all players.

== Usage

=== Frontend

WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:3000 trunk serve

WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://api.konnektoren.help/session trunk serve

WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://match-0-7.helsing.studio trunk serve

=== Backend

RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --features=server --bin server

== Introduction and Goals

Konnekt Session aims to provide a flexible framework for managing multiplayer game sessions. It offers Yew components for the front-end and server-side routing for the players. Clients connect via WebSocket to the server, which handles communication between clients. Every action of the players is broadcasted to all other players in the same lobby, ensuring the state of the lobby is synchronized between all players. Joining clients will get their initial state from the admin.

== Constraints

- The library is implemented in Rust.
- It supports WebSocket communication for real-time updates.
- WebRTC support is in development for future peer-to-peer communication.
- It is designed to be extensible and modular.
- Model and components for specific games will be implemented in separate crates.

== Context and Scope

Konnekt Session is intended for use in simple multiplayer game applications where players manage and play their own games simultaneously. It provides the necessary components to manage players, activities, and communication between clients and the routing server.

The solution is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of session management. The main components include:

- `model`: Defines the core data structures and traits.
- `handler`: Provides command handling logic.
- `components`: Contains Yew components for the front-end.
- `server`: Implements the server-side logic using Axum and WebSocket.

The library is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to implement specific game logic and components in separate crates.

== Solution Strategy

The solution is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of session management. The main components include:

- `model`: Defines the core data structures and traits.
- `handler`: Provides command handling logic.
- `components`: Contains Yew components for the front-end.
- `server`: Implements the server-side logic using Axum and WebSocket.

== Crosscutting Concepts

- **Logging**: The library uses the `log` crate for logging.
- **Serialization**: The library uses `serde` for serialization and deserialization.
- **Concurrency**: The server-side components use `tokio` for asynchronous operations.

== Design Decisions

=== Architectural Decisions

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Decision |Description |Rationale

|Decentralized Architecture
|State is primarily managed by clients, with server acting only as message router
|* Reduces server load and costs
* Improves scalability
* Better fault tolerance
* Allows for offline capability
* Enables peer-to-peer transition

|Rust Implementation
|Core library written in Rust
|* Memory safety
* Thread safety
* Performance
* WebAssembly compatibility
* Strong type system

|WebSocket Communication
|(Current) Real-time communication via WebSocket,
planned migration to WebRTC
|* Low latency communication
* Bi-directional messaging
* Future P2P capabilities via WebRTC
* Reduced server dependency

|Modular Design
|Components are highly decoupled and trait-based
|* Extensibility
* Reusability
* Testing flexibility
* Custom implementations
|===

=== State Management

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Aspect |Implementation |Benefits

|Client State
|Each client maintains full game state
|* Continued operation during connection loss
* Reduced server load
* Quick local updates

|Server State
|Minimal state for connection management only
|* Improved scalability
* Simpler server implementation
* Easier deployment

|State Synchronization
|Broadcast-based with admin as source of truth
|* Natural conflict resolution
* Simple recovery mechanism
* Clear authority chain
|===

=== Future Enhancements

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Feature |Description |Benefits

|WebRTC Migration
|Replace WebSocket with WebRTC for communication
|* True peer-to-peer communication
* Reduced server requirements
* Direct client connections
* Better scalability

|Offline Support
|Enhanced offline capabilities and state management
|* Continued operation without connection
* Local-first architecture
* Better user experience

|State Reconciliation
|Improved mechanisms for state synchronization
|* Better conflict resolution
* Smoother reconnection
* Enhanced consistency
|===

=== Technical Choices

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Technology |Justification

|Yew
|* Rust-based frontend framework
* WebAssembly performance
* Type-safe components

|Axum
|* Modern Rust web framework
* Excellent async support
* Built for WebSocket
* Easy routing

|Tokio
|* Proven async runtime
* Excellent performance
|===

=== Key Design Principles

1. *Decentralization First*
- Design for minimal server dependency
- Enable future peer-to-peer transition
- Support offline-capable operations

2. *Safety and Performance*
- Leverage Rust's safety guarantees
- Optimize for real-time interactions
- Ensure robust error handling

3. *Extensibility*
- Trait-based interfaces
- Pluggable components
- Custom implementation support

4. *User Experience*
- Low latency operations
- Graceful degradation
- Smooth recovery from disconnections

These design decisions create a foundation for:
- A robust, scalable system
- Future peer-to-peer capabilities
- Excellent user experience
- Flexible implementation options

== Risks and Technical Debt

- The current implementation assumes a single server instance. Scalability and fault tolerance need to be addressed in future versions.
- Error handling and validation can be improved.

== Glossary

=== Core Concepts

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Term |Description

|Lobby
|A virtual session room where players gather and participate in activities. Contains information about participants, available activities, and session state. Identified by a unique UUID.

|Activity
|A specific task, game, or challenge within a lobby that participants can engage in. Has states (NotStarted, InProgress, Done) and can collect results from participants.

|Player
|A participant in a lobby with a specific role (Admin, Player, Observer). Identified by a unique UUID and can interact with activities based on their role.

|===

=== Roles

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Role |Description

|Admin
|Session administrator who can manage activities, start/stop them, and control the lobby. Has full control over the session.

|Player
|Regular participant who can join activities and submit results. Has limited control based on activity permissions.

|Observer
|Passive participant who can view activities and results but cannot participate actively. Has read-only access.

|===

=== Technical Terms

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Term |Description

|WebSocket Connection
|Persistent bidirectional communication channel between client and server, enabling real-time updates.

|Command
|Instruction sent between client and server to perform actions (e.g., JoinLobby, StartActivity).

|Activity Result
|Data structure containing a participant's completion data for an activity, including score and time taken.

|Activity Catalog
|Collection of available activities that can be selected for the lobby.

|===

=== States

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|State |Description

|NotStarted
|Initial state of an activity before it begins.

|InProgress
|State when an activity is currently being performed by participants.

|Done
|Final state after an activity is completed and results are collected.

|===

=== Implementation Concepts

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|===
|Term |Description

|Repository
|Trait-based storage interface for managing connections and lobby state.

|Handler
|Component responsible for processing commands and managing state changes.

|Connection
|Represents an active WebSocket connection with associated player and lobby information.

|Command Wrapper
|Structure containing a command along with its target lobby ID and optional authentication.
