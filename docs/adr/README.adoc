== What is an ADR?

An **Architecture Decision Record** (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

ADRs help teams:

* **Understand why** decisions were made, especially when revisiting them later
* **Evaluate trade-offs** explicitly rather than implicitly
* **Onboard new developers** by documenting the reasoning behind key choices
* **Avoid repeating discussions** by providing a reference point

== Format

Each ADR in this directory follows the **Michael Nygard format**:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Section
|Purpose

|**Title**
|Short present-tense imperative statement (e.g., "Use Rust for Implementation")

|**Status**
|Proposed \| Accepted \| Deprecated \| Superseded

|**Context**
|The issue motivating this decision, including constraints and requirements

|**Decision**
|The change we're proposing or have agreed to implement

|**Consequences**
|Positive, negative, and neutral outcomes resulting from the decision

== Guidelines for Writing ADRs

When creating a new ADR:

1. **Number sequentially** – Use the next available number (e.g., `0005-...`)
2. **Use imperative mood** – "Use X" not "Using X" or "We will use X"
3. **Document alternatives** – Show what was considered and why it was rejected
4. **Be honest about trade-offs** – Every decision has downsides
5. **Link to related docs** – Reference DDD docs, code, or external resources
6. **Keep it concise** – Aim for 1-2 pages; details can go in separate docs

== When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when making decisions that:

* **Affect multiple components** or the entire system
* **Are difficult to reverse** (e.g., choice of programming language)
* **Have significant trade-offs** that need to be understood
* **Impact non-functional requirements** (performance, security, scalability)
* **Require explanation** to future team members

== Template

When creating a new ADR, copy this template:
